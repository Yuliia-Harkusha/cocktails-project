That’s right, no one knows the true story behind how the cocktail\r\n        got its name, but there are a few educated guesses. One rumor says that\r\n        the first cocktail appeared in the 17th century, when it was reportedly\r\n        topped with a unique garnish – a rooster’s tail – giving us the name\r\n        cocktail. Another explanation comes from a British publication from\r\n        1936. It described that when British sailors first visited Mexico, they\r\n        were served mixed drinks stirred with a Cola de Gallo, a root shaped\r\n        like a rooster’s tail. As a result, the drink quickly became referred to\r\n        as the cocktail. Yet another everlasting tale connects the mixed drink’s\r\n        origins{\" \"}\r\n        <Href\r\n          href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-cocktail-760163\"\r\n          target=\"_blank\"\r\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n        >\r\n          to the term for a mixed-breed horse\r\n        </Href>\r\n        . When horse racing was big in America – and not just in Kentucky – a\r\n        mixed-breed horse was commonly referred to as a cocktail. At a time when\r\n        horse racing and drinking went hand-in-hand (as they still do), the\r\n        popular mixed drink soon became referred to as a cocktail. Whichever\r\n        story you choose to believe, the name for cocktails has stood the test\r\n        of time.\r\n      </Text>\r\n\r\n      <Heading>\r\n        YOU CAN TASTE THE RECIPE FOR THE WORLD’S EARLIEST COCKTAIL\r\n      </Heading>\r\n      <Text>\r\n        If you walked into a bar today and said, “I want a cocktail,” the\r\n        bartender would probably look at you like you were crazy. While the term\r\n        “cocktail” may refer to hundreds of combinations of drinks today, it was\r\n        originally used to reference one type of mixed drink.

E.\r\n        Alexander in 1831. The base for Alexander’s drink included your choice\r\n        of brandy, gin, or rum with a ratio of one-third spirit to two-thirds\r\n        water. His cocktail also calls for an unspecified amount of bitters,\r\n        enriched with sugar and nutmeg. Despite there being a multitude of\r\n        different cocktail recipes out there today (thank you bartenders), the\r\n        recipe for the signature cocktail lives on, albeit as a slightly\r\n        modernized version. You can make this updated iteration of Alexander’s\r\n        cocktail by combining brandy, orange curacao, bitters, and ice.
